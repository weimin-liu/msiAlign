# How to install

- The main branch always contains the most up-to-date version. You can always download the main branch, install the package in `requirements.txt` and run `msiAlign.py`;
- For the latest binary you can always get from [here](https://github.com/weimin-liu/msiAlign/releases/latest). For now, you will get warning that it's a trojan and will be deleted, it's due to an issue with pyinstaller (e.g. reported [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43777106/program-made-with-pyinstaller-now-seen-as-a-trojan-horse-by-avg), [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788656/exe-file-made-with-pyinstaller-being-reported-as-a-virus-threat-by-windows-defen) and [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/5854)). It's **False Positive**, and you need to allow it to run in your antivirus program. It might be solved in later versions...

# Known bugs (ticked means fixed):

- [ ] Binary created after 25.10.2024 is not compatible with the workspace (json file) generated by earlier versions (one can still use the older binary [here](https://github.com/weimin-liu/msiAlign/releases/tag/v1.0.2)
- [x] Special vertical lines (e.g. sediment start, scale lines) may not be properly deleted 
- [x] If the images are moved after the teaching points are added, the teaching points coordinates are not properly updated
- [x] When duplicate images are added, the image will be re-added to the canvas instead of popping up a warning

# How to use

## For those in a hurry

### Create Metadata Database
Use "File>Crawl Metadata" and navigate to the directory containing the imaging folders (those that end on .i)

### Add images:
Use File - Add images to add images to the canvas. You will be asked if the added image is xray (x) or linescan (l) or msi image (m). The first two labels (x and l) are important for the program to work properly and can only be linked to one image each, the m label is not used at the moment. 

### Organize images:
Put the images in the right place by dragging them around and resize them by dragging the corners. You can ctrl+left click to add vertical lines to the canvas to help you align the images.
Avoid overlapping the linescan or xray images with the MSI scan image.

### Calculate cm/pixel: 
Add two vertical lines on the canvas, for example, at the 1cm and 2cm marks on the line scan image. Then, right click on the vertical lines two set them as "scale lines", and then in menu, click Calc - cm/Px, the program will ask you for the distance between the two lines in cm, and then it will calculate the cm/pixel ratio for the canvas.

### Mark sediment start:
Add another vertical line at the start of the sediment. Right click on the line and select "Sediment start".

### Mark the teaching points:
Add teaching points by shift+left clicking on the canvas. The program will automatically calculate the distance from the sediment start to the teaching point.

### Calculate everything else:
- click Calc - Machine to Real World, you will be asked to attach the metadata database, and then you will be asked if you want to manually or automatically pair the teaching points. If you choose manually, you need to pair the teaching points when asked by the program. If you choose automatically, the program will automatically pair the teaching points in a clockwise order. Otherwise choose manually and follow the instructions.
- If you choose the manual routine (which is the more versatile routine), you need to pair the teaching points when asked by the program. The input should like below. Basically, each line is a pair of teaching points, and they are separated by whitespace.

- After that, click 'Submit' button and the program will calculate the transformation matrix and the transformed coordinates, the results will be saved in the database. If you save the workspace now, the paired teaching points will also be saved, and next time you can just click fill to re-fill the pairs.

## Useful functions:
### Save and load the canvas:
you can save and load the canvas by clicking File - Save Workspace and File - Load Workspace. The workspace file is a json file that contains the image paths, the cm/pixel ratio, the scale lines, the sediment start line, the teaching points.

### View the coordinates of the teaching points:
You can view the coordinates of the teaching points by clicking View - Update TP View. The coordinates will be shown on the side of the canvas.

### More functions hidden in the dev menu, use "Ctrl + p" to show the activate the dev menu.

## Why is it not working?

### For `Calc depth profile`:
- The exported DA txt should be named exactly the same as the spectrum data, for example, if the spectrum data is named `xxxx.d`. The DA txt should be named `xxxx.d.txt`.

## TODO:

- [ ] Add a fallback for the case when neither name matching and first-last-spot-number matching works, ask for user input (spec_id or spec_file_name).
